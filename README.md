This repo contains a sample app which uses a simple token authentication
strategy heavily based on a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/josevalim/fb706b1e933ef01e4fb6) by the
[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) creator and Rails core
contributor [Jos√© Valim](https://github.com/josevalim).

The app serves as an attempt to replace my old sample app which made use of the
[`simple_token_authentication` gem](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication)
which I have come to think is an overkill in the way it must be used for such
a simple and easy task.

The discussion that led me to publish it began
[here](https://github.com/gonzalo-bulnes/simple_token_authentication/issues/94#issuecomment-104404240).

Thanks for reading,

Daniel
